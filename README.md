## Reverse engineering documents from Irata accelerator board clone for Atari 1050 ##

Atari floppy drives were known for its slow operation. As a result, third parties rushed to create solutions to improve the drives as the company wasn't. One of them was Irata (Atari spelled backwards) accelerator board, which conveniently removed the original ROM from the drive and replaced the 6507 with a full 6502. Being considered a permanent mod, the case of modded units is often perforated in order to place a switch.

I fear my unit was not an original Irata board, but a clone and as a result it has hand-made curve traces and no markings, so identification was made visually by comparing Atari 1050 third-party internal expansions with the board in hand.
